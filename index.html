            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and
                philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures
                of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along
                with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced
                artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance
                moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded
                individual music artist in history.

            <h3>Early Life </h3>
            <p>Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in
                the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson
                Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson, played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a
                country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father,
                Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a
                local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.Joe's great-grandfather,
                July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.
                Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito,
                Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.</p>
            <p>
                In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included
                Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. Michael said his father
                told him he had a "fat nose", and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled
                that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish
                any mistakes. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael. Katherine said that although whipping
                came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up.
                Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings,
                which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Michael
                said his youth was lonely and isolated</p>

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5. In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang the Temptations' "My Girl". From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances. In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.</p>
            <p>In January 1970, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be There". In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house at Hayvenhurst, a two-acre estate in Encino, California. During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol. Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973), and Forever, Michael (1975). "Got to Be There" and "Ben", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby Day's "Rockin' Robin".</p>
            <p>In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, a musical film directed by Sidney Lumet, alongside Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross. The film was a box-office failure. Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums. 

                Jackson's fifth solo album, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds. It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "Off the Wall", "She's Out of My Life", and the chart-topping singles "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You". The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist. Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.</p>
